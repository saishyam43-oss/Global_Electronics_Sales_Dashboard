Global Electronics: Retail Sales Operations Dashboard

</div>

Client Background & Project Context

Global Electronics is a (fictional) multinational retailer specializing in high-end consumer electronics. Founded in 2010, the company expanded rapidly from its North American roots, establishing a significant physical presence across Europe and Australia with over 70 stores, complemented by a robust e-commerce ("Online") platform.

For years, GE was a market leader, but following a record-breaking year in 2019, the company began to see a significant and worrying decline in sales. Leadership was unable to diagnose the root cause: was this a market-wide (e.g., pandemic) problem, a failure in customer retention, a shift in product demand, or regional underperformance?

The primary stakeholders—the VP of Sales and the Director of Marketing—initiated this project to transform 5+ years (2016-2021) of raw, messy, and siloed transactional data into a unified, reliable, and actionable analytics dashboard to guide their recovery strategy.

Business Problem & Objective

The core business problem was a lack of visibility. The leadership team was "flying blind" and could not answer critical, data-driven questions:

Why did our strong sales growth reverse after 2019?

Are we failing to acquire new customers, or are we losing our loyal ones?

Which products and categories are our true profit drivers, and which are "cash cows" (high revenue, low margin)?

Where are our most (and least) efficient stores and regions?

The objective of this project was to clean, model, and analyze five years of data (from 5 tables: Sales, Products, Customers, Stores, Exchange Rates) to build a "single source of truth" dashboard. This tool would diagnose the root causes of the sales decline and identify the most valuable opportunities for growth.

North-Star Metrics (Key Business Goals)

To provide actionable answers, the analysis was focused on a set of "North-Star" KPIs that measure the complete health of the business:

Total Revenue & YoY Growth: To measure top-line performance.

Total Profit & Profit Margin %: To measure bottom-line efficiency.

New Customer Acquisition (YTD): To measure market expansion.

Customer Retention (Recency): To measure customer loyalty and churn.

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): To measure the long-term value of a customer.

Average Order Value (AOV): To measure the average basket size.

Sales per Square Meter: To measure the efficiency of physical stores.

Executive Summary Dashboard

This dashboard serves as the "mission control" for the project, providing a high-level, interactive overview of the entire business. It is the first page of the 5-page Power BI report and summarizes the answers to the main business questions.
