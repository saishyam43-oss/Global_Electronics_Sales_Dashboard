### 1. Client Background & Project Context

Global Electronics is a (fictional) multinational retailer specializing in high-end consumer electronics. Founded in 2010, the company expanded rapidly from its North American roots, establishing a significant physical presence across Europe and Australia with over 70 stores, complemented by a robust e-commerce ("Online") platform.

For years, GE was a market leader, but following a record-breaking year in 2019, the company began to see a significant and worrying decline in sales. Leadership was unable to diagnose the root cause: was this a market-wide (e.g., pandemic) problem, a failure in customer retention, a shift in product demand, or regional underperformance?

The primary stakeholders—the **VP of Sales** and the **Director of Marketing**—initiated this project to transform 5+ years (2016-2021) of raw, messy, and siloed transactional data into a unified, reliable, and actionable analytics dashboard to guide their recovery strategy.

### 2. Business Problem & Objective

The core business problem was a **lack of visibility**. The leadership team was "flying blind" and could not answer critical, data-driven questions:

* **Why** did our strong sales growth reverse after 2019?
* **Are** we failing to acquire new customers, or are we losing our loyal ones?
* **Which** products and categories are our true profit drivers, and which are "cash cows" (high revenue, low margin)?
* **Where** are our most (and least) efficient stores and regions?

The **objective** of this project was to clean, model, and analyze five years of data (from 5 tables: `Sales`, `Products`, `Customers`, `Stores`, `Exchange Rates`) to build a "single source of truth" dashboard. This tool would diagnose the root causes of the sales decline and identify the most valuable opportunities for growth.

### 3. North-Star Metrics (Key Business Goals)

To provide actionable answers, the analysis was focused on a set of "North-Star" KPIs that measure the complete health of the business:

* **`Total Revenue & YoY Growth`**: To measure top-line performance.
* **`Total Profit & Profit Margin %`**: To measure bottom-line efficiency.
* **`New Customer Acquisition (YTD)`**: To measure market expansion.
* **`Customer Retention (Recency)`**: To measure customer loyalty and churn.
* **`Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)`**: To measure the long-term value of a customer.
* **`Average Order Value (AOV)`**: To measure the average basket size.
* **`Sales per Square Meter`**: To measure the efficiency of physical stores.

### 📊 Growth Trend — *Revenue Peaked in 2019*

<div align="center">

<img src="Images/Executive_Summary/Sales_Peak.jpg" alt="Sales peaked in 2019" width="750"/>

</div>

📈 **Insight:**  
Between 2016–2019, Global Electronics achieved consistent revenue growth, peaking at **\$5.7M** in Q4 2019.  
However, revenue fell sharply by **60% over the next two years**, with average quarterly revenue dropping from **\$2.6M → \$1.0M**.

💡 **Implication:**  
The business was overly reliant on volume-driven sales and lacked resilience in repeat purchases, exposing vulnerabilities when external shocks hit.

### 🧩 Product and Customer Revenue Drivers

<div align="center">

<img src="Images/Executive_Summary/Top3.jpg" alt="Top Product Lines and Customer Segments" width="750"/>

</div>

📈 **Insight:**  
- **Computers** and **Home Appliances** generated **>60% of total profit**.  
- The **65+ age group** alone contributed **~50% of total revenue**, while younger cohorts (18-35) were underrepresented.

💡 **Implication:**  
Dependence on a narrow product mix and aging demographic poses long-term growth risks — diversification is essential.

### 👥 Customer Lifecycle Overview

<div align="center">

<img src="Images/Executive_Summary/Customer_Base.png" alt="Customer Lifecycle & Retention" width="500"/>

</div>

📈 **Insight:**  
Of the **15K customers**,  
- **60.6%** are **Dormant**,  
- **22.2%** are **Unacquired**,  
- only **5%** remain **Active**.

💡 **Implication:**  
Reactivation campaigns and retention programs can yield the fastest recovery by focusing on dormant but high-value customers.
