## 🏢 Client Background

GLOBAL ELECTRONICS (Images/Logo_GE.png)

**Global Electronics** is a *hypothetical multinational retailer* specializing in consumer electronics and appliances, operating across **four continents** with **hundreds of stores**.  
The company’s sales data was obtained from the **Maven Analytics Retail Sales dataset**, adapted for analysis.

Over the past few years, leadership noticed signs of:
- Slowing **revenue growth** in mature markets,  
- **Margin compression** due to discount-driven strategies, and  
- Declining **customer retention** in certain regions.

To address these challenges, the **Operations & Strategy team** partnered with the **Analytics Division** to build a unified *Sales Operations Dashboard* that would track performance from multiple angles — product, customer, time, and geography.
